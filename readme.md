# Plant monitor project

What? This project is an open source alternative to [Xiaomi Plant Sensor](https://xiaomi-mi.com/sockets-and-sensors/xiaomi-huahuacaocao-flower-care-smart-monitor/) and other similar products.

Why? All (most of) those project collect your (some) information and don't allow you to customize the project or install the dashboard at home.

## Solution

The solution will be based on several products:

- A piece of hardware that will collect your plant data:
  - 3D model of the solution
  - Requirements:
    - Bluetooth connexion
    - Moisture sensor
    - Light sensor
    - Temperature sensor

- A web/mobile application where you will be able to see the collected information
  - Requirements:
    - Works on a raspberry pi, even the smallest
    - No external requirements (you own your system)
    - Works on mobile and desktop

- A shared database with some plants information/requirements to be able to grow (TBD)
